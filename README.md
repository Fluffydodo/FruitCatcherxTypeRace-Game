# FruitCatcher x TypeRace

A 2D arcade-style game where you control a character to catch falling items — but beware of bombs! Catch the right items and type their names to score points.

## How to Play

You control a character that moves left and right to catch items falling from the sky. Your goal is to:

1. **Catch items** that are **not bombs**.
2. **Avoid catching bombs** — they reduce your score and end the game.
3. **When you catch a valid item**, its name will appear on the screen. **Type it correctly** to earn points!

React fast, type faster!
